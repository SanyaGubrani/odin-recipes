                <h1>Steps:</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, yogurt, egg, and melted butter until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. It's okay if there are a few lumps.</li>
                    <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to lightly coat the surface.</li>
                    <li>Pour a ladleful of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until you see bubbles forming on the surface, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep them warm.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.</li>
                    <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate chips.</li>
